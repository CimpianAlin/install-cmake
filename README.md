# install-cmake
Download and compile [CMake](https://cmake.org/) for subsequent use by `npm --global install`.
This package installs CMake 3.5.2.
Note that because `cmake` takes such a long time to download and compile,
it is recommended that you install this package in global mode.

Based on Stanley Gu's [cmake](https://github.com/stanleygu/cmake) for npm.
